1. pygame.Vector2 and/or pygame.math.Vector2 can't be imported (I assume this is a known limitation).

2. MOUSEBUTTONDOWN events with button == 4 and 5 (e.g. scrollwheel events) aren't received by the game in browser.

3. Arrow key and space events cause the page to scroll in the browser (I think the htmlized version of the game needs to consume these?)

4. pygame.draw.line and pygame.draw.rect look different in the browser (I think it's using anti-aliasing, whereas it doesn't do that in pygame.draw).

5. Not really a bug, but is there a way to set the intended FPS for games in the browser? Or is it just set to 60 always?

6. It seems that the main.py module needs to have a "def run_game():" method as its entry point for the web version of the game. I didn't see this documented anywhere.

7. Performance in the browser is pretty significantly worse than with regular python, e.g. 7 FPS vs. 60 FPS (for this game anyways, which uses a lot of pygame.draw calls). Not sure if that's possible to fix.

8. Surface.subsurface doesn't seem to exist. Code:

  full_sheet = pygame.image.load("assets/art.png").convert()
  for i in range(4):
    Art.ENEMIES.append(full_sheet.subsurface([i * 16, 0, 16, 32]))

AttributeError: subsurface

9. Surface.get_at seems to return some sort of JS array in web mode that can't be sliced. (This prevents it from being passed into Surface.set_colorkey, since that method slices its input array). Code: 

  full_sheet = pygame.image.load("assets/art.png").convert()
  print("get_at =", full_sheet.get_at((0, 0)))
  Art._color_key = full_sheet.get_at((0, 0))[:3]

get_at =   <Javascript Uint8ClampedArray object: 22,22,22,255>
